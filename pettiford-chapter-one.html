  Pettiford received his early musical training and musical experience in the
  family band, Doc Pettiford and His Family Orchestra. The band featured his

  Pettiford was educated in the basics of music theory by his older sister,

  This group featured Pettiford on both the cello (which in some instances was

  harpist as regular members. </p>
