            <!--TODO ADD LINK TO PDF DOWNLOAD--TODO ADD LINK PAGE FOR OTEHR JAZZ BASS DISSERTATIONS-->
            <p>   This document was originally researched, written and defended as the final step of the Doctor of Musical Arts Degree
            program in Jazz Performance at the University of Texas at Austin's Butler School of Music. It has not been made easily accessible from the UT Austin library's online repository, so I have decided
            to make it public through this website. It is presented largely in it's original text, save for additions to these acknowledgements and the formatting neccessary
            to effectively present it via web browsers. It was also done as an exercise in learning to code an easy to navigate site featuring complex text, graphics, and a retracting navigation menu. This site was designed and contructed by myself using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.
            The source text was exported from Microsoft Word and reformatted to html first by Word, and then spot adjusted manually, which will be apparent from viewing the source code. The original document can be found <a href="#">here</a> as a pdf file. All solos were transcribed by myself,
            and, at times present minor differences from previously published transcriptions of Oscar Pettiford.</p>

            </p>

            <!-- TODO add contact form/email link-->
            <p>Please drop me a message via the <a href="#">contact form </a>if you find this document interesting or useful in your personal or academic research. As mentioned above, a pdf is available for download.
              I look forward to hearing from you! If you have a paper or resources that you would like featured on the <a href="#">related links</a> page, please forward it to me.</p>
            <br />
            <!--TODO add the last members name-->
          <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank my professors and the members of my commitee: <a href="#">John Fremgen</a>, <a href="#">Jeff Hellmer,</a>
            <a href="#">Dr. John Mills</a>, <a href="#">Dr. David Neumeyer </a>, and <a href="#">Dr. Laurie Scott</a>. Each one of them pushed me to become a better writer, musician, student, and teacher. Additional, I have to thank all of my fellow students
          , who were immensely talented, and inspired me to work harder than ever to keep up.</p>
            <br />
            <p>This document and web publication is dedicated to my family, Lissadell, Emma, Neave and Josefine.
              They endured the many sacrifices of time and resources required to complete this document and the DMA program.</p>
