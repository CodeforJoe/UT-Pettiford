		<strong>Foreword</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Oscar Pettiford was one of the most important and innovative jazz bass
		soloists in the 1940's and 1950's. Pettiford further developed the
		"horn-like" approach of bass soloing first pioneered by Jimmy Blanton,
		by transferring the language and phrasing of bebop onto the double
		bass. In doing this, Pettiford was an early prototype of the "modern"
		jazz bassist. In his hands, the double bass became an instrument
		capable of a high level of artistic expression, utilizing many of the
		same melodic devices as the best jazz wind players of his day.
		Pettiford's influence has been profound, although often indirect, and
		traces of his style can be found in the styles of many modern jazz
		bassists.
	</p>
	<p>
		This paper draws on the analysis of transcribed bass solos, as well as
		historical accounts, to establish Pettiford's accomplishments as a
		soloist, examine his style in relation to his peers, and discuss his
influence and relevance to the styles of three modern bass soloists.		<strong></strong>

	<p>
		<strong>Early Life (1922-1943)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Oscar Pettiford (1922-1960) was born on an Indian reservation in
Okmulgee, Oklahoma, into a large musical family.		<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Pettiford received
		his early musical training and musical experience in the family band,
		Doc Pettiford and His Family Orchestra. The band featured his father,
"Doc" Pettiford, and included his mother and his ten siblings.		<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Pettiford began
		dancing with the band at age six, later playing the piano, trombone and
trumpet before taking up the bass.		<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Pettiford was
		educated in the basics of music theory by his older sister, Leontine,
who played piano and reeds and who arranged most of the band's music.		<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> The family band
		toured the southern and midwestern United States before eventually
		basing itself in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Pettiford was raised.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford encountered many influential musicians at after-hours jam
		sessions in Minneapolis. It was in one of these sessions where he met
Milt Hinton, bassist with Cab Calloway,		<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> jammed with the
electric guitar pioneer Charlie Christian, and had a "cutting contest"		<a></a>
		<a id="_anchor_1" href="#_msocom_1" name="_msoanchor_1">
			[Jb&#59360;&#6154;&#59360;&#49151;&#50944;1]
		</a>
		with Jimmy Blanton, bassist with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the
progenitor of the modern jazz bass solo.		<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the early 1940's, musical work was scarce in Minneapolis. Pettiford
		briefly gave up professional music and went to work in a war plant
		while studying tailoring. He returned to professional music at the
urging of bassist Milt Hinton.		<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> Pettiford's first
		major opportunity in jazz came in 1943 when saxophonist and bandleader
		Charlie Barnet hired him to be part of a <a>two-bass team </a>
		<a id="_anchor_2" href="#_msocom_2" name="_msoanchor_2">
			[Jb&#59360;&#6154;&#59360;&#49151;&#50944;2]
		</a>
		with Chubby Jackson. Pettiford only stayed with Barnet for five months,
		however, and this role was undocumented because of an American
Federation of Musicians' recording ban in effect at the time.		<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> He was dismissed when
		his competitive nature and abrasive personality combined to cause
friction between himself and bassist Chubby Jackson.		<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> After his departure
from Barnet's band, Pettiford relocated and settled in New York City.		<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> It was here that
		he immediately became part of the nascent bebop scene, which first
		developed in Harlem and then later took hold at several nightclubs
		located on <a>52<sup>nd</sup></a>
		<a id="_anchor_3" href="#_msocom_3" name="_msoanchor_3">
			[Jb&#59360;&#6154;&#59360;&#49151;&#50944;3]
		</a>
		<sup> </sup>
		Street, between 5th and 6th avenue.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Early Career in New York City (1943-1945)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		In New York, Pettiford's first gig was with pianist and bebop pioneer
		Thelonious Monk at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem. Minton's Playhouse was
		the setting for some of the earliest bebop jam sessions attended by
		musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Jimmy Blanton and
		Charlie Christian. In June of 1943, Pettiford worked for a short time
		at the Onyx Club on 52<sup>nd</sup> Street with famed trumpeter Roy
Eldridge, who ultimately fired <a>Pettiford because of</a>		<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> his
		<a id="_anchor_4" href="#_msocom_4" name="_msoanchor_4">
			[Jb&#59360;&#6154;&#59360;&#49151;&#50944;4]
		</a>
constant tardiness and his drinking.		<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notwithstanding these setbacks, Pettiford's reputation as a bassist
		grew quickly, and by the end of 1943 he had won first place in the bass
category of <em>Esquire</em> magazine's All-American Jazz Band Poll.		<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> The winners of
		this poll, which included Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, Sid Catlett,
		and Coleman Hawkins, performed a concert that was recorded and released
		as <em>The First Esquire Concert</em><em> </em>(Laser Light 15 723).
	</p>
	<p>
		Due largely to the success of the <em>Esquire </em>award, Pettiford was
		able to book a gig on 52<sup>nd</sup> Street at the Onyx Club as
		co-leader with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, pianist George Wallington,
tenor saxophonist Don Byas and drummer Max Roach.		<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> This group, which
		was also unrecorded, is now recognized as the first bebop ensemble on
		52<sup>nd</sup> Street, a strip of nightclubs that would become, for a
		short time, a bastion for bebop musicians. Pettiford took a direct role
		in the musical direction of this band, and according to Budd Johnson, a
		saxophonist who performed with the group, half of this group's
		repertoire was written by Pettiford. "One Bass Hit," which was then
known as "For Bass Faces Only," was included among these works.		<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1944, after just a few months of work in New York City, Pettiford's
		heavy drinking and confrontational personality caused a falling-out
		between him and Gillespie, which, in turn, caused the breakup of the
		ensemble. Following that band's dissolution, Pettiford led various
bands on 52<sup>nd</sup> Street, eventually playing and recording with<a>The Boyd Raeburn Band (1944-45)</a><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a>		<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a>
		<a id="_anchor_5" href="#_msocom_5" name="_msoanchor_5">
			[Jb&#59360;&#6154;&#59360;&#49151;&#50944;5]
		</a>
		before traveling to California to perform with legendary saxophonist
Coleman Hawkins. Pettiford appeared with Hawkins in the 1945 film,		<em>The Crimson Canary,</em> although another bassist overdubbed the
bass part heard in the movie.		<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a> Pettiford also
		recorded as a leader of an eighteen-piece group in 1945 for the Manor
record label under the name Oscar Pettiford and His 18 All-Stars.		<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Time with Duke Ellington (1945-1948)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		In November of 1945, Pettiford was hired to fill the bass chair in the
		Duke Ellington Orchestra, succeeding bassist Jimmy Blanton, who died in
		1942.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a> Pettiford
		performed and recorded with Ellington from 1945 through March of 1948,
returning to the ensemble after that for occasional performances.		<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a> Near the end of
		his time with the Ellington band, however, Pettiford grew restless with
		them, only enjoying the concerts "because then we'd get to play some
		new things. At dances and theaters we'd play the same things over and
over again. There was nothing to inspire you."		<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>1948-1950</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		After leaving Ellington, Pettiford worked at The Three Deuces on 52nd
		Street first with pianist Erroll Garner and later with pianist George
Shearing, trombonist Kai Winding, and trumpeter Miles Davis (1948).		<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a> Pettiford also led
		a short-lived band at The Clique nightclub that included Miles Davis,
		Fats Navarro, Lucky Thompson, Dexter Gordon, Milt Jackson, Bud Powell
		and Kenny Clarke.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[24]</a>
		This ensemble also disbanded as a result of conflict between Pettiford
and the other musicians.		<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1949, Pettiford joined Woody Herman's "Second Herd" band. During his
		time with the Herman band, Pettiford broke his arm playing baseball.
		Before he broke his arm but during his time with Herman, Pettiford
		experimented with the cello as part of a prank on the bandleader. After
		his arm was broken, he was unable to play bass due to the cast. During
		this time, Pettiford instead devoted his energy to practicing the
		cello, which he tuned in fourths and played pizzicato, essentially as a
smaller bass sounding an octave higher than the conventional jazz bass.		<a></a>
		<a id="_anchor_6" href="#_msocom_6" name="_msoanchor_6">
			[Jb&#59360;&#6154;&#59360;&#49151;&#50944;6]
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Bandleader and Sideman (1950-1958)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		During the early 1950's Pettiford continued working as a bandleader,
		engaging in an ill-fated State Department tour and making recordings on
		both bass and cello for Charles Mingus's Debut record label, the Roost
record label, and others.		<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[26]</a> During this
		period, Pettiford also worked with Charlie Shavers and Louis Bellson
(1953) and in Bud Powell's trio (1953).		<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[27]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1955, Pettiford was hired to lead a band at the Caf&#233; Bohemia.
		Pettiford's group was a last minute replacement for one led by Charlie
Parker, who died before his scheduled opening.		<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a> Pettiford led a
		band that included trombonist Jimmy Cleveland, saxophonist Jerome
		Richardson, pianist Horace Silver, drummer Kenny Clarke and alto
		saxophonist Julian "Cannonball" Adderley, who was discovered after
Pettiford was tricked into letting him onto the bandstand to sit in.		<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[29]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
Pettiford recorded with Miles Davis on his 1955 album,		<em>The Musings of Miles (</em>Original<em> </em>Jazz Classics
		OJC-004).<em> </em>The band featured on this recording, minus
		Pettiford, would eventually form the nucleus of Davis' classic
		mid-fifties quintet. According to Red Garland, Davis originally sought
		to have Garland, Oscar Pettiford, Sonny Rollins and Max Roach make up
his working quintet.		<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a> When Davis was
		ready to put his own band together, however, Pettiford, Rollins and
		Roach were already working with their own groups and were, therefore,
		unavailable.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="">[31]</a> Paul
		Chambers, a gifted young bassist inspired by both Blanton and Pettiford
		was instead hired. Chambers would remain with Davis's groups for eight
		years and in this position influence countless other bassists.

	<p>
		From the mid 1950's until leaving for Europe in 1958, Pettiford
		recorded prolifically both as a leader and as a sideman with both large
		ensembles and numerous small combos. In 1956, Pettiford assembled a
		thirteen-piece big band, which debuted at New York's Town Hall. This
		band, the Oscar Pettiford Orchestra, played together for eighteen
		months and featured a group of seasoned musicians that included Ernie
		Royal, Art Farmer, Jimmy Cleveland, Gig Gryce, Lucky Thompson, Benny
		Golson, Art Farmer, Tommy Flanagan, David Amram, and Osie Johnson,
		among others.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title="">[32]</a> This
		group featured Pettiford on both the cello (which in some instances was
		amplified with an added electronic tremolo effect) and bass, at times
		simultaneously via overdubbing. This group also expanded the
		<a>
			traditional instrumentation of the jazz big band by employing two
			French horns and a harpist as regular members.

	</p>
	<p>
		As a sideman, Pettiford contributed to several notable recordings
during this time, including Thelonious Monk's<em>Monk Plays Ellington (</em>1955), <em>Brilliant Corners </em>(1956		<em>)</em> and Sonny Rollins' <em>Freedom Suite</em>, (1958) which
		featured Rollins, Pettiford and Max Roach as a piano-less trio.

		<a name="_Toc164304555">Chapter II: Analysis of Pettiford's Solos</a>
	</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>Overview</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		In the history of the double bass as a solo instrument in jazz, Oscar
		Pettiford was a bridge linking the work of Jimmy Blanton and the
		generations of jazz bassists that followed him. Pettiford stood out
		from many of his contemporaries in the 1940's and 1950's, building on
		Blanton's accomplishments as a soloist and discarding the heavier
		root-oriented approach to soloing typical of many of his
		contemporaries. Pettiford was able to both translate and transfer much
		of the vocabulary and conventions of bebop including the use of
		chromaticism, "horn-like" phrasing, scales/arpeggios and altered
		pitches to the bass.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="_Toc164304556">2.1: "Burt's Pad"</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
This solo on "Burt's Pad" is included on disc two of the collection		<em>Oscar Rides Again</em> (Proluxe 5002). It was recorded on March 13,
		1954. Present with Pettiford on this recording are Kai Winding,
		trombone; Al Cohn, tenor sax; Henri Renaud, piano; Tal Farlow, guitar;
		and Max Roach, drums.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Phrasing</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the most remarkable aspects of Pettiford's solos is his
		phrasing. In this solo, as is characteristic of his style, Pettiford
		uses "horn-like" lines consisting primarily of eighth-notes, which he
		builds into lengthy multi-measure statements. In mm. 1-4, Pettiford
		plays two phrases, each two measures long. The third and concluding
		phrase, mm. 5-9, is five measures long and overlaps the beginning of
		the second "A" section.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
			Avoidance of Roots and Fifths as Prominent Pitches in Solos
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		By his avoidance of the heavy use of roots and fifths, Pettiford breaks
		with the common tendency of bassists to outline the same pitches
		required of walking bass lines. This, along with the inclusion of the
		upper extensions of the harmony, often within arpeggios,
		<a>
			gives his solos harmonic depth, and a sense of motion often lacked
			by other solo bassists during his time.
		</a>
		<a id="_anchor_8" href="#_msocom_8" name="_msoanchor_8">
			[Jb&#59360;&#6154;&#59360;&#49151;&#50944;8]
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a></a>
		<a>
			In this solo, Pettiford avoids placing the root or fifth of the
			harmony on the downbeats of chord changes. In m. 1, he plays the
			major seventh two times, on the downbeat of beats one and three,
			while placing the root on the upbeat of one and the fifth on the
			upbeat of two. In m. 3, Pettiford plays the second (or ninth) on
			beat one, then outlines the C Major chord from the third to the
			ninth. The third phrase, although it begins in m. 4 with a root,
			anticipates the following measure's harmony by half of a beat
			causing the ninth to land on the downbeat of m. 5.
		</a>
		<a id="_anchor_9" href="#_msocom_9" name="_msoanchor_9">
			[Jb&#59360;&#6154;&#59360;&#49151;&#50944;9]
		</a>
		Pettiford does however, use chord roots prominently in m. 4 along with
		a flatted ninth as a chromatic upper neighbor.

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Lyrical Ideas</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		When the harmony of the tune shifts to a more distantly related chord,
		Pettiford uses lyrical ideas that clearly express that harmony using
		the lower chord tones. In mm. 2, 10, 26 and 34, Pettiford uses a
		similar lyrical idea over the Ab6 harmony that emphasizes the root and
		major sixth.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304646">Example </a>
		3: Lyrical idea in mm. 2, 10, 26 and 34 of "Burt's Pad."

			src="file://localhost/Users/josef/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_image006.png"
		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		In mm. 16-18 Pettiford also marks the transition to the bridge with a
		lyrical idea that features the root, third and fifth of the new key
		center.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304647">Example </a>
		4: Lyrical idea in mm. 16-18 of "Burt's Pad."

		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Non-Harmonic Pitches </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Another distinguishing feature of Pettiford's solos is his use of
		chromatic passing tones to smoothly connect his solo lines. In this
		solo, he uses three such tones, which can be found in mm. 12, 21, and
		24-25.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304648">Example </a>
		5: Chromatic passing tones in mm. 12, 21 and 24-25 of "Burt's Pad."

			src="file://localhost/Users/josef/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_image010.png"
		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford also makes regular use of chromatic upper and lower neighbor
		tones in his solos. He uses the flatted fifth as a chromatic upper
		neighbor in m. 4, 22, and in m. 28.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304649">Example </a>

	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford also uses lower chromatic neighbor tones in mm. 23 and 32.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Enclosures</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford also uses chromatic enclosures, which are another key device
		associated with the bebop vocabulary. Pettiford uses chromatic
		enclosures twice in this solo in mm. 6-7, and in m. 11.
	</p>
	<p>

		2.2: Analysis of "Perdido"
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Overview</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		"Perdido," from <em>Oscar Rides Again</em> (Proluxe 5002), was recorded
		in New York City on June 12, 1956, by Pettiford's big band the Oscar
		Pettiford Orchestra. In this solo, as is characteristic of his general
		approach, Pettiford employs long eighth-note lines, arpeggios,
		chromaticism and motivic development.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Phrasing</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		In this solo, as in "Burt's Pad," Pettiford achieves a sense of
		fluidity by using long, flowing phrasing. In mm. 1-7 of this solo,
		Pettiford employs a three-phrase statement, clearly punctuating the end
		of each phrase with a dotted quarter note in mm. 3, 5, 7. The first two
		phrases of this statement occur in mm. 1-3 and mm. 3-5, and are each
		eight beats long, beginning on the "and" of two and ending on the
		downbeat of beat one. The third and concluding phrase, in mm. 5-7,
		while also beginning on the "and" of two, is two beats longer and ends
		on an upbeat. Pettiford also varies his phrase endings by changing the
		direction and interval in each case. The first phrase ends with a
		descending minor second interval, the second an ascending major second
		and the third with an ascending minor third.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304653"> </a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Example 10: Phrase development in mm. 1-7 of "Perdido."

		<img
			width="398"

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Recurring Motives</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford also creates cohesion in this solo by using recurring
		motives. In mm. 1-2, 5-6, and 13 he plays an arpeggio figure over the C
		min7 that includes the third, fifth, seventh and ninth. In mm. 2 and 6,
		he appears to extend the Cmin7 harmony until beat three of the measure
		when he sounds the pitch A, the third of the F7 chord.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304654">Example </a>
		11: Recurring motive over Cmin7 in mm. 1-2, 5-6 and 13 of "Perdido."
	</p>
	<p>
		<img
			width="398"
			height="68"
			src="file://localhost/Users/josef/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_image022.png"
		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford uses a similar descending motive three times in this solo,
		over G7 in m. 8, F7 in m. 10, and Cmin7 in m. 29. Consistent with the
		phrase development just discussed, Pettiford augments the phrase length
		and changes the ending interval in each use. He also moves the motive
		closer to the beginning of the measure each time he uses it. In the
		first occurrence of this motive, mm. 8-9, the phrase is six beats long
		and ends with a descending minor second. The second, in mm. 10-11, is
		six and a half beats long and ends with an ascending major second. The
		third and concluding iteration of this motive, mm. 29-32, occurs near
		the end of the form. It is part of a four-measure phrase that ends with
		a descending minor second.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Arpeggios as a Recurring Motive</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford plays a similar motive over both the Dmin7 and G7 chords in
		mm. 4, 12, and 32. In m. 4, he arpeggiates the lower three tones of the
		Dmin7 chord then plays the flatted ninth (as an upper chromatic
		neighbor), fifth, root and seventh of G7. In m. 12 Pettiford plays the
		complete descending Dmin7 arpeggio followed the same G7 pattern as m.
		4. In m. 32, he appears to anticipate the G7 by two beats with third,
		fifth, seventh and flatted ninth used again as an upper chromatic
		neighbor tone.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304658">Example </a>

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Lyrical Idea Marking Form of Tune</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Although Pettiford overlaps a phrase across the A and B sections of the
		tune, he marks the arrival of the bridge in m. 17 by playing a lyrical
		idea containing the root, third, and fifth of the D7 chord. He also
		does something similar to this in his solo on "Burt's Pad."
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304659">Example </a>
		16: Lyrical phrase outlining the bridge in mm. 14-17 of "Perdido."

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Non-Harmonic Tones</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		As discussed previously in the analysis of "Burt's Pad," Pettiford's
		solos stand out because of his use of chromatic passing tones to create
		smooth, flowing solo lines. In this solo, Pettiford employs nine
		chromatic passing tones, each of which occurs only as part of
		descending lines. These passing tones occur in mm. 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11,
		21, 29 and 30.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304660">Example </a>
		17: Chromatic passing tones in mm. 29-30 of "Perdido."

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Blues language </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford implies the blues sound with a Db, the flatted third of the
		key, in m. 14. Although this pitch is also the raised fifth of the
		prevailing F7 harmony, Pettiford slides into it from below implying the
		Bb blues sound. He returns to the Bb blues sound again in m. 18,
		playing both the major and minor (flatted) third of Bb over the D7
		harmony. In example 19, Pettiford plays an Eb7 arpeggio over the F7
		harmony in m. 24. The resulting pitches, G, Bb, and Db, clearly
		introduce the blues language motive that Pettiford then develops
		through repetition in mm. 25-28. The use of blues language on non-blues
		tunes is a practice also associated with bassist Ray Brown, who listed
		Pettiford as one of the two greatest influences on his music, the other
being Jimmy Blanton.		<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title="">[39]</a>

	<p>
		<strong>Summary</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		Pettiford, as evidenced in these solos, possessed a highly developed
		solo style. In his solos he broke free from many of the melodic
		patterns associated with bass lines, incorporating many of the devices
		associated with the bebop horn players of his day: multi-measure
		eighth-note phrases, arpeggios, chromatic passing tones, chromatic
		upper and lower neighbor tones, and altered tones. The fact that he
		performed on other instruments before the bass may have been a factor
		leading to his adoption of the "horn-like" approach to soloing on the
		bass. Pettiford's ability to translate the vocabulary of bebop to the
		bass is even more remarkable considering his lack of formal training on
		the instrument. In Pettiford's time, relatively few jazz bassists had
		access to formal instruction; this lack of technical training
		undoubtedly hindered many from developing sophisticated solo styles.
		Furthermore, the instrument's setup prior to the development of
		electronic amplification and steel strings created enormous
		difficulties in projecting the sound of the bass through an ensemble.
		Much of bass technique at this time focused on producing adequate
		volume at the expense of other qualities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford's ability to achieve a relatively high level of musical
		fluency on the instrument, despite his lack of training and the
		inherent physical difficulties presented by the bass, is a testament to
		his innate musical abilities. His solos, which are remarkable on their
		own merits, stand out even further when compared to the solos of many
		of his contemporaries in the bebop scene of the late 1940's and early
		1950's.

		<strong>Overview</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The following solos were selected for analysis due to their inclusion
		on recordings made by alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, one of the
		founders of bebop. These recordings, made between 1947 and 1950,
		indicate that many bassists of the bebop era were not, at first, able
		to assimilate the genre's melodic and harmonic concepts into their
		solos.

		Bassist Tommy Potter (1918-1988) was a member of Charlie Parker's band
		from 1947 to 1950; and he worked with many bebop musicians, including
Fats Navarro, Wardell Gray, Stan Getz and Bud Powell.		<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title="">[40]</a> Potter's solos do
		not reflect any attempt to translate the solo language of bebop into
		that of the bass, and are in stark contrast to Pettiford's more highly
		developed solo style. Of the twenty-six tracks Potter recorded with
Charlie Parker, as collected on		<em>The Complete Savoy &amp; Dial Master Takes</em>, Potter "solos" on
		ten. Each one is essentially a walking bass line with light
		accompaniment from the rest of the rhythm section. This bass solo on
		"Bongo Bop" (SVY 17149) was recorded in 1947 with the Charlie Parker
		Quintet and is representative of Potter's usual approach. Featured on
		this recording is Miles Davis, trumpet; Charlie Parker, alto sax; Duke
		Jordan, piano; Max Roach, drums.

		Instead of in any sense being solos themselves, Potter's solo breaks

		<a name="_Toc164304561">3.2 Red Callendar's solo on "Cool Blues"</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Overview</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Red Callendar (1916-1992) was a Los Angeles bassist who recorded as a
		member of the Charlie Parker Quintet during Parker's time in Los
		Angeles, and he was among Charles Mingus' first bass teachers.
		Callendar solos with a heavier, more root-oriented approach that seems
		to relate more to the tuba, which he also played. Callendar recorded
		"Cool Blues" in 1947 with Charlie Parker's quintet in Hollywood,
		California, on <em>The Complete Savoy &amp; Dial Master </em>(SVY
		17149). Featured on this recording are Charlie Parker on alto sax,
		Erroll Garner on piano, and Harold "Doc" West on drums.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Roots and Fifths as Prominent Note Choices</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike Pettiford, Callendar favors the root and fifth of the harmony as
		prominent notes in this solo. He emphasizes these pitches at the
		beginning and end of phrases in mm. 1-6, 9-11, 11-12, 13-16, 17-20,
		21-22.

		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Non-Harmonic Tones</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		Callendar's use of chromaticism in this solo is extremely limited. He
		uses only one chromatic passing tone, and one chromatic lower neighbor
		tone, which can be found in mm. 12 and 19 respectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304666">Example </a>

			src="file://localhost/Users/josef/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_image046.png"
		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Callendar uses wider intervals, including a ninth in m. 21, and he
		seems to imply a tri-tone substitution in m. 22 by using the flatted
		ninth and raised fifth of G7. Due to the relatively wide interval
		between these two notes, Callendar's use of these altered tones are not
		"horn-like" but are instead more idiomatic to the fingerboard layout of
		the double bass.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304667">Example </a>

	</p>
	<p>
		Callendar's limited use of chromaticism, combined with his preference
		for arpeggio patterns favoring roots and fifths, give this solo a heavy
		"chugging" feel that is more tuba-like and far less fluid and
		bebop-oriented than Pettiford's style.

		<strong> </strong>
		Bassist Nelson Boyd (1928-1985) worked with Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman
		Hawkins, Dexter Gordon, Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, and Charlie
		Parker. <a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title="">[41]</a> He takes a
		one-chorus solo on his namesake tune "Half Nelson," which was recorded
on August 14, 1947, by the Miles Davis All Stars on		<em>The Complete Savoy &amp; Dial Master Takes </em>(SVY 17149).
		Present on this recording are Miles Davis, trumpet; Charlie parker,
		alto sax; John Lewis, piano; Max Roach, drums.
	</p>
	<p>
		Boyd also uses a more rudimentary approach to bass soloing as compared
		to Pettiford, relying largely on roots and fifths as prominent pitches
		in this solo. Boyd uses the root or fifth as the first and last note of
		his phrases in mm. 3-8, 9-10, and mm. 11-14.

	<p>
		In this solo, Boyd uses only two chromatic devices common to bebop. In
		m. 1, he plays a chromatic lower neighbor to approach the third of C
		major. In measure 12, he plays a chromatic passing tone between the
		sixth and fifth of the D7 chord.

		<strong>Phrasing and Motivic Development</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		In comparison to Pettiford, Boyd's rhythmic and motivic development is
		also less developed. Unlike Pettiford, who varied the length,
		placement, and intervallic direction of his lines, Boyd relies
		exclusively on short phrases that do not increase in length or cross
		the internal boundaries of the tune as established by the chord
		changes. Boyd also does not make use of any recurring melodic or
		rhythmic motives to create a sense of structural unity in the solo. He
		does, however use a sequence in the last two measures of the tune, mm.
		15-16. It is a descending sequence, which can be played by moving the
		same fingering pattern and hand position down the neck in half steps.
		He ignores the AbMaj7 chord in measure 15, instead planing this pattern
		downward to create a descending upper and lower chromatic line.

		<strong> </strong>
		Curley Russell (1917-1986) was a contemporary of Oscar Pettiford who
		worked with many of the same musicians. Russell worked with groups led
		by Tadd Dameron, Bud Powell, Horace Silver, and Art Blakey, and he was
a member of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker's 1945 quintet.		<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title="">[42]</a> Although he was a
		proficient accompanist, his solos also fall short of the standard set
by Pettiford. Dizzy Gillespie in <em>To Be Or Not to Bop </em>recalls:		<em> </em>"&#8230;Curley got around, but his solos weren't in the vein
of Jimmy Blanton, Oscar Pettiford, and Ray Brown."		<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="">[43]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		"Mohawk" was recorded in 1950 for the album <em>Bird and Diz</em>
		(Verve compact disc 314 521 436-2). Present on this recording are Dizzy
		Gillespie, trumpet; Charlie Parker, alto saxophone; Thelonious Monk,
		piano; Buddy Rich, drums. While Russell displays a more developed
		melodic and rhythmic sense than do the other bassists discussed so far,
		his articulation is heavy and his tone lacks the clarity of
		Pettiford's.
	</p>
	<p>
		Russell's preference for using the root and the fifth as a starting or
		ending note adds to this heaviness. In mm.1-2, Russell begins and ends
		his first phrase with a root Bb, and ends the phrase with the same
		note, which is the fifth of the Eb7 chord. Russell's note choices in
		mm. 1-2, which do not clearly outline the seventh of or third of Eb7 in
		m. 2, suggest that he is blanketing the Bb major scale. He also ends
		phrases with the root in mm. 6, 7, and with a fifth in m. 12.

		<strong>Altered Pitches</strong>

		Russell plays two altered pitches in this solo and in each instance,
		these tones are used either as part of arpeggios or as the final pitch
		in a phrase, rather than as part of any stepwise or scalar motion. In
		m. 6, he plays the raised fifth as part of a descending Eb7#5 arpeggio.
		In m. 10, Russell plays the flatted fifth over the F7 harmony.

		<strong>Non-Harmonic Pitches</strong>

	<p>
		<strong>Summary</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The analysis of the solo styles of these bassists helps to provide the
		historical context needed to properly evaluate Pettiford's
		accomplishments. These solos give evidence of the degree to which many
		of Pettiford's peers had not yet fully assimilated the language of
		bebop into their solo styles. These solos, excepting Potter's, do
		contain some of the elements associated with bebop, including
		eighth-note phrases, chromaticism, altered-pitches and syncopation.
		However, none of these bassists were able to fully integrate these
		elements into a solo style that could be considered "horn-like." These
		solos demonstrate that Pettiford, for his time, had developed a very
		advanced improvisational style on the bass.

		<a name="_Toc164304564">
			Chapter IV: Analysis of Three Modern Bass Soloists
		</a>
	</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>Overview</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Oscar Pettiford's recordings and compositions have influenced many jazz
		bassists both during his lifetime and after his death in 1960. Since
		that time, jazz bassists have achieved much higher levels of technical
		proficiency on the instrument; most often, this has been the result of
		formal music study. The characteristics of the modern jazz sound
		include a bright and sustaining tone, the expanded use of the high
		register or "thumb position" for soloing, and the use of two-finger
		pizzicato to play fast "horn-like" solo improvisations, often with
		legato phrasing. In order to achieve this sound the majority of modern
		jazz bassists also make use of steel strings, reduced string height (in
		comparison to players of the 1950's), and since the 1970's, electronic
		amplification that allows them to project clearly in all registers of
		the instruments. It should be noted that Pettiford was experimenting
		with amplification and electronic effects as early as the 1950's. The
		three bassists selected for analysis are all virtuosos who represent
		three subsequent generations of jazz bassists who have sought to
		develop the bass as a melodic instrument.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although it is impossible to determine the total extent of Pettiford's
		(or any other musician's) influence on these bassists, each have
		followed Pettiford's model and brought the bass to the forefront as a
		solo voice. In their efforts to create solos of the caliber of the
		greatest horn players in jazz, they have undoubtedly drawn not only on
		other bassists for inspiration, but directly from other
		instrumentalists as well.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="_Toc164304565">4.1 Scott </a>
		LaFaro
	</h2>
	<p>
		Scott LaFaro (1936-1961) is best known for his work as a member of the
		Bill Evans Trio. Like Pettiford, LaFaro is recognized as one of the
		most important figures in the development of double bass after Jimmy
Blanton, Oscar Pettiford and Ray Brown.		<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="">[44]</a> In addition to
		being the first well-known "modern" bass soloist in jazz, LaFaro, along
		with his band mates in the Evans trio, helped to create a more
		interactive rhythm section style. Although he is most often associated
with this "conversational" or "internalized beat"		<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title="">[45]</a> style of playing
		which the Bill Evans Trio pioneered, he was well versed in several jazz
		bass styles, as evidenced by his work with a diverse groups of artists
		including Stan Kenton, Ornette Coleman, Stan Getz, Buddy Morrow, and
		Booker Little.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title="">[46]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Several parallels can be drawn between LaFaro's and Pettiford's lives
		and careers. Both came from musical families, studied several
		instruments before the bass, and made quick advances in the jazz world,
		and also died relatively young. LaFaro, however, had more formal music
		training. He played saxophone in the high school band, studied the
		first two Simandl bass method books, and briefly majored in music at
Ithaca College at Ithaca, New York.		<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title="">[47]</a> Although LaFaro
		drew inspiration directly from horn players, he was still enamored of
the preceding generation of bassists, including Pettiford.		<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">[48]</a> Eldee Young, who
		met and jammed with LaFaro in the late 1950's, speaks of LaFaro's
		admiration for Pettiford, among other bassists, when he says, "George
		Duvivier, Percy Heath, and Oscar Pettiford were heroes to Scotty and
		me."<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title="">[49]</a>
	</p>
	<p align="center">
		<strong>Analysis of "Hip"</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
"Hip," a twelve-bar blues, was recorded on Hampton Hawes' album		<em>For Real</em> (Fantasy 1992 OJCCD-713-2). Present on this recording
		are Hampton Hawes, piano; Harold Land, saxophone; and Frank Butler,
		drums. LaFaro's solo on this tune shows many commonalities with Oscar
		Pettiford's style along with some key differences. This album was
		recorded in California in 1958, the year before LaFaro made his first
		studio recording with the Bill Evans Trio. LaFaro, here, displays a
		highly refined solo style but, as an accompanist, adheres to a more
		functional role.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Phrasing, and Motivic Development </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		As Pettiford does in the previously discussed solos, LaFaro develops
		his solo lines using multi-phrase statements, varying their rhythmic
		placement, duration and, alternating the direction of the ending
		interval. In mm. 1-2, LaFaro begins with a three-and-a-half beat motive
		beginning on the "and" of three and ending on the downbeat of two with
		a descending major second. This motive is suggestive of the blues sound
		while also accommodating the Eb7 chord in m. 2. The second phrase, mm.
		3-4, is six-and-a-half beats long, beginning on the "and" of one and
		ending on the "and" of three with an ascending minor third. This phrase
		is more closely related to the blues sound, featuring both the major
		and minor third prominently. The third and concluding phrase, mm. 5-8,
		begins on the "and" of two, but lasts for twelve-and-a-half beats,
		ending with an ascending D min7 arpeggio, then resolving down by a
		half-step to the third of the G7 chord.
	</p>
	<p>

			src="file://localhost/Users/josef/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_image060.png"
		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		LaFaro also makes use of eighth-note triplet arpeggios, which Pettiford
		seldom used, as motivic material. LaFaro, also differing from the
		Pettiford solos previously analyzed, develops his lines using
		motivic-elaboration. LaFaro develops a triplet motive using
		motivic-elaboration in mm. 10-16. In m. 10, LaFaro plays a fragment of
		the motive which features the raised fifth prominently. He follows this
		in mm. 11-12 with the complete motive, followed by a variation in mm.
		12-13, which is phrased it across the bar-line. A second variation
		occurs in mm. 14-15, this time with the motive expanded in length,
		while a third variation occurs in mm. 15-16, diminished in length. This
		motive occurs three more times in mm. 19-23, before the end of the
		chorus.

	<p>
		LaFaro may have adapted this concept from horn players such as Sonny
Rollins, one of his major musical influences;		<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title="">[50]</a> or, it is possible
		that he learned it from his mentor, bassist Red Mitchell, who was also
known to use this technique in his solos.		<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title="">[51]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Non-Harmonic Pitches</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		LaFaro, like Pettiford, also uses chromatic and altered pitches as part
		of his solos. LaFaro, however, employs them more frequently and in
		greater variety than Pettiford. This solo contains chromatic passing
		tones in mm.17, 25-26 and 28. He also uses chromatic lower neighbor
		tones in mm. 11-12, 14-15, 19-23, 25. LaFaro, further, combines two or
		more types of chromatic pitches into one phrase. One such passage is
		mm.25-26, in which occur two chromatic lower neighbor tones, two
		chromatic passing tones and a flatted fifth.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304676">Example </a>
		33: Chromatic and altered pitches in mm. 25-26 of "Hip."

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		In m.22 and m. 32, he uses the flatted ninth and raised ninth. A flat
		nine raised nine pair also appears in conjunction with the raised fifth
		in mm. 19-20.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, LaFaro had more formal music training than
		Pettiford, which most likely helped him achieve his great dexterity on
		the instrument. In mm. 34-35 LaFaro plays a descending line that is
very similar to an exercise found in		<em>The New Method for Double Bass </em>by F. Simandl, a source that he
used in his early training.		<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title="">[52]</a>

	</h2>
	<p>
		George Mraz (b.1944) is a Czechoslovakian-born bassist who has been a
		significant influence in American jazz since his emigration to the
United States in 1968.		<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title="">[53]</a> Mraz, like
		Pettiford, first studied other instruments, including the violin and
		saxophone, before switching to the bass. He received classical training
		on the bass in Czechoslovakia at the Prague Conservatory and later
attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston on scholarship.		<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title="">[54]</a> He is known for
		his clear tone, remarkable intonation and virtuosic technique.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mraz, who considers Oscar Pettiford to be "one of the greatest jazz
		bassist (and jazz cello players) of all time," first became aware of
		Pettiford's reputation while working with several former associates of
		Pettiford, including saxophonist Stan Getz, pianist Tommy Flanagan, and
guitarist Attila Zoller.		<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title="">[55]</a> Although drawing
		inspiration from many sources, Mraz admits to being influenced by many
		aspects of Pettiford's playing including "his sound, time, conception,
		and his ability to fit into many styles of music, which at the time
wasn't really everybody's strong point."		<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title="">[56]</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Mraz's use of steel strings, low string height, and electronic
		amplification allow him to perform fleet solos at faster tempos than
		Pettiford could have achieved with the one-finger pizzicato technique
		and bass setup of the 1940's and 50's. The added sustain of the steel
		strings and his use of left-hand pizzicato and two finger pizzicato
		technique allow him to play legato articulations that would be
		difficult or impossible with the bass setup that most bassists used in
		the 1950's. George Mraz's solo on Charlie Parker's "Confirmation," was
		recorded with in 1977 with pianist Tommy Flanagan and drummer Elvin
		Jones on the album<em> Eclypso </em>(Enja 2088).<em> </em>Mraz's solo
		on this tune is an excellent example of the translation of the bebop
		vocabulary onto the bass.

	<p>
		<strong>Non-harmonic Pitches</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Mraz, like Pettiford, makes use of chromatic passing tones to connect
		his lines. In this solo, however, he uses them much more frequently:
twenty-seven times throughout his two choruses (sixty-four measures).		<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title="">[57]</a> In m.4, Mraz uses
		a descending chromatic passing tone as part of a bebop clich&#233;
		phrase. Mraz, in contrast to Pettiford, who mainly used chromatic
		passing tones as part of descending lines, employs chromatic passing
		tones in both his ascending and descending lines.
	</p>

		"Confirmation."

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Mraz, like Pettiford, also makes use of chromatic neighbor tones. Mraz
		favors the lower which he uses nine times, in mm.2, 14, 21, 33, 40, 49
		and 54-55.
	</p>
	<p>

			src="file://localhost/Users/josef/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_image078.png"
		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast, he only uses a chromatic upper neighbor tone three times,
		in mm.5, 13 and 39. Mraz combines all three in mm.5-6.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304683">Example </a>

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Altered pitches</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Mraz also makes just two clear uses of altered pitches in this solo,
		the flatted fifth or raised fourth in m.8, and the flatted ninth as an
		upper chromatic neighbor tone in m. 41. Pettiford also favored using
		the flatted ninth in this manner.

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Motives and Sequences</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Mraz, like Pettiford, plays lyrical ideas and recurring motives to
		delineate the form of the tune. Mraz, however, develops these lyrical
		ideas in sequence over several measures. This is more in keeping with
the style of Scott LaFaro, whom he has also cited as an influence.		<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title="">[58]</a> In m. 25, the
		beginning of the last A section of the form, Mraz plays a lyrical
		motive (model), that he develops using model-sequence technique in mm.
		26-28, anticipating the next measure's harmony by a half a beat in each
		sequence. Following this motive, in m. 29, Mraz plays an arpeggio, then
		a short chromatic passage. He repeats this sequence again in
	</p>
	<p>
		mm. 57-61 with the original model slightly altered rhythmically.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304685">Example </a>

		"Confirmation."

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		While Pettiford overlapped his phrases over the boundaries of the A and
		B sections of "Perdido" and "Burt's Pad," in this solo Mraz marks the
		end of his second A section by playing a short rhythmic motive using
		the root of the F major chord, which is also the piece's melody note.
		In m.24, the last measure of the B section, Mraz emphasizes the
		impeding change back to the key of F major with a third and root of the
		harmony with a diminution of this same rhythmic motive. He uses a
		partially augmented version of this motive in the last measure of the
		second B section, mm.47-48.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Toc164304687"> </a>

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Mraz also creates a cohesive statement by beginning and ending his
		first chorus, mm. 1 and 31-32, with syncopated motive based on the
		root. Again, rather than phrasing over the form boundaries of the tune
		like Pettiford, Mraz instead chooses to clearly mark the form of the
		tune.

		4.3 John Patitucci
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		John Patitucci (b.1959) is a prominent bassist, composer and professor
		of music at the City College of New York. He performs on both the
		double bass and the six string electric bass. Classically trained, he
		is renowned for his virtuosity and technique on both instruments. He
		first came to prominence performing on electric bass with Chick Corea's
		Elektric Band, one of the leading fusion groups of the 1980's. He has
		since performed with many respected jazz musicians, including Wayne
		Shorter, John Scofield, and Michael Brecker. Although on his earlier
		recordings he possessed very bright and ringing tone, his sound has
		become darker in recent years, due, in part to his use of newer
		varieties of bass strings made to emulate the sound of gut strings.
		Amplification systems and pickups for the double bass have also
		improved greatly since the 1970's and 1980's, allowing a more naturally
		resonant and woody tone to be projected.
	</p>
	<p>
		Patitucci, although aware of Pettiford, was instead drawn to bassists
		Ray Brown, Ron Carter, Percy Heath and Paul Chambers as major
		influences.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title="">[59]</a> Thus,
		any initial Pettiford influence would have occurred indirectly as
		Brown, Chambers, and Carter all "came up" under Pettiford's influence.
		In the early 1990's, well after he was established as a jazz artist,
		Patitucci rediscovered Pettiford's music. Patitucci was "blown away by
		his flexibility, virtuosity and just his energy&#8230;. I was intrigued
		by his playing but didn't want to copy it&#8230;.I did learn a few
things, not formal transcriptions."		<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title="">[60]</a> He was, however,
		inspired to learn his music. In 2001, Patitucci recorded Pettiford's
		"Bohemia After Dark" on his album entitled <em>Communion</em> (Concord
		Records, 2001). Patitucci cites Sonny Rollin's <em>Freedom Suite,</em>
on which Oscar Pettiford played, as one of his motivations to record<em>Remembrance, </em>his recent piano-less trio album.		<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title="">[61]</a>
	</p>
	<p align="center">
		<strong>Analysis of "I Love You"</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong><em> </em></strong>
		"I Love You" is a thirty two measure tune written by Cole Porter that
was recorded on guitarist Mike Stern's 1997 album entitled		<em>Give and Take </em>(WEA/Atlantic 7567 83036 2)<em>&#173;</em>.
		While this solo is "horn-like," employing some techniques similar to
		Pettiford, is less clearly influenced by the bebop language, drawing,
		as it does, also on developments in jazz since the 1960's. Patitucci,
		like the other players discussed in the chapter, makes use of both the
		lower range of the bass and of the high register to create contrast and
		highlight different sections of the tune. Patitucci also develops
		recurring syncopated motives over the course of the solo.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Avoidance of Roots and Fifths</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Patitucci, after Pettiford, avoids total reliance on the root and fifth
		as prominent notes in his solo lines. In mm. 5-7, as in the melody of
		the tune, Patitucci begins his phrase on the ninth of G minor7 and ends
		on the sixth of the F Maj7 chord. Patitucci also uses the ninth and
		sixth beginning and ending notes in mm.12-15.

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Non-Harmonic Pitches</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		Patitucci makes use of chromatic passing tones and chromatic lower
		neighbor tones several times throughout the solo in mm. 10-12, 19, and
		29; these chromatic tones do not, however, comprise a major element of
		this solo because of it's more angular nature. Patitucci also makes use
		of the flatted ninth, which Pettiford also favored, in mm. 5,29, 36, 58
		and 60. He also uses the raised ninth in mm. 34-35. Patitucci, however,
		applies non-harmonic tones in a looser fashion that Pettiford. In m.
		30, he uses what appears to be a four-note segment of the diminished
		scale, and in mm. 19-20, he seems to side-slip out of the prevailing
		harmony.

	<p>

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Patitucci also does not acknowledge the Gmin7 b5 chord in m. 9.
		Instead, he uses an F Major 7 (add9) arpeggio and an F major scale
		pattern that continues until beat three of measure 10 on which he plays
		the seventh and the third of C7(b9). On beat four of measure nine he
		plays the pitches Eb and F, which form an enclosure of the seventh of
		the FMaj7 chord in m. 9. He then plays a line based on the A major
		scale from beat three of measure eleven to measure fifteen.

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Lyrical Ideas</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Patitucci, like Pettiford, uses lyrical ideas when the harmony shifts
		away from the home key and to provide contrast to his denser eighth
		note passages in the solo. In mm. 13-15 Patitucci plays a lyrical idea
		when the harmony shifts to A major.

		<strong>Motives and Sequences</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		Patitucci, like Pettiford also makes use of recurring motives in this
		solo to create cohesion and thematic unity. Patitucci, however, uses
		syncopated rhythmic motives for this purpose. The most frequent
		syncopation is the "and" of four tied across the bar line. This first
		occurs in mm.3-4 of the solo and occurs again in mm.6-7, 22-23, 24-25,
		and 37-38.

		<strong>Summary</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> </strong>
		Each of the three bassists analyzed in this chapter possesses a style
		that, though keeping with the general melodic "horn-like" solo concept
		espoused by Pettiford, retains a distinctive and personal approach.
		Since Pettiford's lifetime, jazz has continues to evolve and
		accordingly, each bassist has incorporated new harmonic and melodic
		approaches into their playing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Scott LaFaro, the earliest of the three modern bassists analyzed, is
		the only player who was active in the New York City jazz scene during
		Pettiford's lifetime. Like Pettiford, he used multi-measure phrases and
		flowing eighth-note lines in his solos. LaFaro, however, made use of
		triplets more extensively than Pettiford, and used model-sequence
		technique to develop his motives. LaFaro, in addition to utilizing the
		high register of the bass, makes a more extensive and varied use of
		chromaticism than Pettiford. LaFaro's expansion of the melodic
		"horn-like" bass solo is aided by his superior technique, lower string
		height and his use of two-finger pizzicato technique.
	</p>
	<p>
		George Mraz, who has spent a great deal of time performing with
		Pettiford's former associates and is an admirer of Pettiford's work,
		adheres most closely in "Confirmation" to Pettiford's bebop oriented
		conception. Like Pettiford, Mraz constructs his solos from flowing
		eighth-note lines, employs chromatic devices common to bebop, and marks
		the form of the tune with lyrical ideas and recurring motives. Mraz,
		however, develops his motives using model sequence technique and makes
		much greater use of chromaticism than Pettiford. Mraz also expands
		Pettiford's concept into the high register of the bass and employs the
		legato phrasing and two-finger pizzicato technique characteristic of
		modern bassists.
	</p>
	<p>
		John Patitucci, the most recent of the three bassists studied, has a
		style that, while still reflecting Pettiford's "horn-like" concept,
		applies a looser and more angular approach. Patitucci, like Pettiford
		uses recurring motives and lyrical ideas to create a sense of structure
		in his solo, however, relies less overtly on the typical elements of
		the bebop language. This is perhaps more reflective of Patitucci's
		early experience performing with fusion oriented ensembles. Patitucci,
		like LaFaro and Mraz, makes extensive use of the high register of the
		bass in his solo.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each of these bassists have had several advantages not available to
		Pettiford: each received formal music training, utilized relatively low
string height, and with the exception of LaFaro,		<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title="">[62]</a> utilized steel
		strings and electronic amplification to achieve a bright and sustaining
		sound. These advantages allowed players develop the "horn-like" melodic
		solo approach to levels that technically surpassed Pettiford's work in
		the 1940's and 1950's.

	<h1>
		Conclusion
	</h1>
	<p>
		Oscar Pettiford clearly stood out among his peers in the mid-1940's and
		1950's as one of the first bassists to adapt the bebop vocabulary to
		the double bass. In doing this, Pettiford earned the admiration of
		numerous bassists including Ray Brown, Charles Mingus and Paul
		Chambers. Pettiford, after Jimmy Blanton, was one of the most important
		figures in establishing the bass as a capable and respected solo
		instrument in jazz.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford's work as a bassist, alone, would probably have been
		sufficient to distinguish him from others during the bebop era, but his
		work as a composer and bandleader was also remarkable. The
		bassist-bandleader was and still is a relatively unusual figure in
		jazz. In these capacities, Pettiford set musical precedents for such
		groups as those of Charles Mingus, Paul Chambers, and, more recently,
		John Patitucci, Dave Holland, and Avishai Cohen. As the leader of his
		own groups, Pettiford gave himself a platform from which to highlight
		and develop his talent on an instrument known primarily it's supporting
		role. These settings also allowed him to perform on the cello, which he
		used as a higher pitched extension of his bass.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fact that the American Federation of Musicians' recording ban
		prohibited any recorded documentation of Pettiford's participation in
		the earliest bebop ensembles has caused his contributions to early
		bebop ensembles be unnoticed by many. His expatriation to Europe, and
		premature death in 1960, were factors that further vitiated his
		reputation among many musicians.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is quite possible that Pettiford's greatest influence on the jazz
		world today has been indirect. Among many others influenced by
		Pettiford, some discussed in more detail above, is Ray Brown, who
		achieved prominence with the Oscar Peterson trio in the 1950's and
		1960's, Paul Chambers and Ron Carter, who gained exposure with Miles
		Davis' groups. Scores of influential and accomplished bassists,
		including Sam Jones, Buster Williams, George Mraz, Ray Brown, Chuck
		Israels and Larry Grenadier have given Pettiford credit for influencing
		their sound and style in some way. It is significant, further, that
		Pettiford's music is now a required part of the repertoire for many
		aspiring jazz bass students.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pettiford's extensive discography as a sideman and a leader has been
		reissued and is now widely available in various formats. This has
		allowed more recent generations of bassists to be informed by his
		playing. A clear and accurate discography of his recorded output,
		however, does not exist; and no major written work has exclusively
		devoted to his historical contributions to jazz.
	</p>
	<p>
		This study of Oscar Pettiford's solo style and its relation to that of
		other bassists of the bebop era show that for his time, Pettiford had
		few peers. The analysis of the music of Scott LaFaro, George Mraz and
		John Patitucci give evidence that Pettiford's solo style contained many
		elements which would later become part of the modern bass sound.
		Although Pettiford's approach is not explicitlycopied by any of these
		bassists, each of them builds on elements of the "horn-like" solo
		concept that Pettiford championed in the 1940's and 1950's.
